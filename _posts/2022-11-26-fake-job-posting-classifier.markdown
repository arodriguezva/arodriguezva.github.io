The Fake Job Posting Classifier is a machine learning project that aims to classify job postings as either genuine or fake. This project uses two popular algorithms, MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive, to train and test a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a job posting is legitimate or not.

The project involves preprocessing a large dataset of job postings, cleaning and formatting the data, and extracting relevant features such as job title, description, company name, location, and required skills. The data is then split into training and testing sets and fed into the MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive algorithms to train the machine learning model.

After training, the model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine its effectiveness in classifying fake job postings. The model is then fine-tuned and optimized to achieve the best possible performance.

The Fake Job Posting Classifier has a wide range of potential applications, including identifying fraudulent job postings on job search platforms, preventing job scams and identity theft, and improving the overall quality of job postings on the internet.

The MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive algorithms are particularly well-suited for this project because they are fast, accurate, and can handle large datasets with high dimensionality. These algorithms are widely used in natural language processing tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis, and have been shown to be effective in detecting fake news and spam.

Overall, the Fake Job Posting Classifier is an exciting machine learning project that showcases the power of MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive algorithms in solving real-world problems.
